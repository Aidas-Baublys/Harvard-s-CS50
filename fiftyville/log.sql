-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the
-- thief there withdrawing some money.

-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone
-- who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning
-- to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone
-- to purchase the flight ticket.
