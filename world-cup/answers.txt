Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Most of them where incorrect regrdless of simulation number as it based on random probability.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After around 100000, but it still would be very cheap to run, so might increase a lot more, but it wont help.
